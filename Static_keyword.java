		//we can put that in a separate area we

		//or method area, it's also part of the ram

		//going to put this university
		//university will not be part of the objects 
		//but it will be part of a common area from which 
		//it is available to all the objects
		//so this kind of a variable that is common to all the objects and
		//that is allocated in a separate area called class area or 
		//method area and it is initially loaded and initialized

		//STATIC VARIABLES
		//1.static variable is a variable that is common to all objects 
		//it's not part of any specific object you don't need an object 
		//to actually call a static variable
		//2.static variable is initialized only once at the start of execution
		//3.static variable can be accessed using the class name (student.univ_add)
		
		//STATIC METHODS
		//no need to create an object to invoke the static method
		//method invocation happens using class name
		//declaring a static method - sample
		//public static void display(){}	
		//invoking static method
		//no need to create another student object to invoke count_objects()
		student.count_objects();

		//STATIC METHOD PROPERTIES
		//1. Can access only static variables, can't access 
		//class variables directly inside the static method
		//2. Can invoke only static methods, can't invoke 
		//non static methods from within a static method
		//3. this keyword cannot be used with static
		//4. super keyword cannot be used with static
		//5. static methods can be overloaded but cannot be overridden
